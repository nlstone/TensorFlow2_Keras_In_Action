Studing Machine Learning and Deep Learning by Jupyter Notebook, this is the best way in my idea.
I'll try to implement all common machine learning model with TensorFlow2 & Keras by Jupyter Notebook.
In the first phase, plan to implement these following modules:
1 Tensorflow and keras basic
2 Image claasification
3 RNN: RNN LSTM GRU
4 NLP: seq2seq attention transformer
5 GAN
6 Image Detection: Faster_RCNN YOLO SSD
7 Reinforcement Learning
